    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I'm an employee at a naval company specializing in the assembly and
      installation of ventilation and air conditioning systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before taking this job, I was a student who loved(and love) computer
      science! I always liked messing around with computers since I was a kid,
      when my dad introduced me into this fantastic world, and since then it
      became my first and most important Hobby to this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I really like doing all kinds of stuff but the real thing that gets me
      going is programming and reverse engineering softwares: I really like
      watching and understanding how people would program their stuff and learn
      form them.
